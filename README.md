Rudimentary graphics engine written with OpenGL and for Windows. Quite the work in progress


This project started in 2012, when I wanted to learn exactly how everything worked. 
Uses both Windows and OpenGL, which are probably two things that are fairly opposed to each other.
Is basically a straight rendering engine. Much of this code requires cleanup before serious progress,
but is an incredibly valuable learning experience.
